Pointer codes

C. Seshadhri, Jun 19

----------------------------------------

This is a collection of teaching codes for explaining pointers, especially in regard to structures, arrays, and memory allocation.
Each C file is a standalone snippet of code.

USAGE: For any file (say, deref-struct.c), run as:
    gcc <C FILE>
    ./a.out

The compilation may generate warnings, since the code prints out pointer values. You can ignore those warnings.

For each code, read it to see what it is printing. Try to make sense of the output. If you can understand all the output,
it will give a strong understanding of pointers.
