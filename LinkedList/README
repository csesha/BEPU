USAGE (in main folder):
    <EXECUTABLE NAME>  <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>

    <INPUT FILE> is the name of a file with a list of operations to be performed on a linked list.
    <OUTPUT FILE> will have the results of these operations.

----------------------------------------------------

The following explains the input/output format.

I/O:

The input file should have a series of operations in each line. Each line is of one of these forms.
We break the operations into two categories, those that print into the output file, and those that do not.
Note that the operations that do not print still change the linked list.

Operations that do not print:
i <INT>: insert <INT> into list
d <INT>: delete <INT> from list
dl <INT>: delete last occurrence of <INT> from list
da <INT>: delete all occurrences of <INT> from list
rev: reverse the linked list
rot <INT>: do a circular rotate of the list by <INT> entries. Suppose the list was 10 20 30 40 50. The operation "rot 2" would lead to 40 50 10 20 30.

Operations that print:

p: print list in order, as a single line
len: print length of list
c <INT>: print number of occurrences of <INT> 
f <INT>: find <INT> in list, if present, print "FOUND <INT>". If not present, print "<INT> not present"
pal: determine if list is a palindrome (this means that the reverse of the list is the same as the list). Output "PALINDROME" if the list is a palindrome. Otherwise output "NOT PALINDROME"

All the printing is done in the <OUTPUT FILE> provided as a command line argument. For each operation that prints, the output should be in a separate line of the output file.
